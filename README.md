# ComfyUI Universal Styler
```py
VERSION: Pre-Alpha Release: 0.4.1 - UPDATED 02/2025 - Licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0
```
Hi, this is a research Node based project on *Artificial Intelligence* using ComfyUI[^1] visual editor with **VRAM Local processing**[^2] focus in mind. This custom node is intended to serve the purpose to *offer a large palette of prompting scenrarios*, based on Public Checkpoint Models[^3] OR/AND **Private custom Models and LoRas**[^4]. It includes a set of workflows.

## :radio_button: Objectives

The objectives of this project are to offer different digital creation tools, using ComfyUI as the main platform and only in local environment. Here is a non-exhaustive list of planned features:

- **Image Nai-Filter (parametric)**
- **Image Nai-Tonemapper (parametric)**
- **Image Nai-transformer overlayer**
- **Image 2 text (prompt, neg, metadata)**
- **Text Nai-Prompter load/concat csv**

utils:

- Text 2 string (with preview)
- String 2 text
- load image +
- compare slider preview images
- metadata constructor

## :radio_button: ComfyUI Installation and Custom Nodes

After installing [**ComfyUI**](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) services with your prefered plateform (i am suggesting the use of [**Stability Matrix**](https://github.com/LykosAI/StabilityMatrix) as it is easy to install and give a lot of controls), make sure you install the additional and necessary custom nodes. Then you need to install [GIT software](https://git-scm.com/) (if it is not done already) on your computer. To install these custom nodes, open a CMD window in the \ComfyUI\custom_nodes folder. And "git clone" each one of them. By adding the link after "git clone".
